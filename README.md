# Elements of AI: Building AI

[Online course](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) by University of Helsinki. The goal of the course is to give introduction on how to get started on building your own AI with Python.
The course is a continuation to [Intoduction to AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) course which I have also studied.
